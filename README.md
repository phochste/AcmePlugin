# AcmePlugin

This is a Chrome Extension used to open web resources with
existing Solid Apps.

In the `Options` section of the plugin you can configure
which Solid apps you would like to use in a context menu.
E.g. you can configure apps for editing files, file browsing,
setting permisions and much more. If a Solid App can be
triggered by opening a URL, it can be used in this extension.

The defined context menus are available on every page, link
and image.
